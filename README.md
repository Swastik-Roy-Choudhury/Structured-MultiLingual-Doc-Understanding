# Week 1 Milestone: OCR Pipeline & Spatial Data Extraction

## 🎯 Project Overview

This milestone marks the completion of Week 1 in my **Structured Extraction and Intelligent Multi-lingual Document Understanding** project. I have successfully implemented a comprehensive OCR pipeline with spatial data extraction using the RVL-CDIP dataset.

## 📚 Dataset

- **Dataset**: RVL-CDIP (Ryerson Vision Lab Complex Document Information Processing)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pdavpoojan/the-rvlcdip-dataset-test]
- **Categories**: 16 document types (advertisement, budget, email, file_folder, form, handwritten, invoice, letter, memo, news_article, presentation, questionnaire, resume, scientific_publication, scientific_report, specification)
- **Sample Size**: ~2,300(approx) TIFF images per category
- **Storage**: Google Drive (`MyDrive/passionproject/resources/RVL_CDIP/`)

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Environment Setup & Data Verification
- Mounted Google Drive and installed all required dependencies
- Verified dataset structure across all 16 categories
- Created organized output directory structure for processed data

### 2. Dataset Analysis & Visualization
- Generated comprehensive dataset statistics
- Analyzed file counts and dimensions per category
- Created distribution visualizations (bar charts and pie charts)

### 3. Advanced Preprocessing Pipeline
I implemented a robust preprocessing system that includes:
- **Noise Removal**: Using fast Non-Local Means Denoising
- **Deskewing**: Automatic rotation correction for tilted documents
- **Contrast Enhancement**: CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)
- **Binarization**: Otsu's thresholding for clean text extraction

### 4. OCR Implementation
- Implemented **Tesseract OCR** engine for text extraction
- Added spatial coordinate extraction (bounding boxes)
- Captured confidence scores for quality assessment
- Prepared setup instructions for Google Vision API (premium option)

### 5. Batch Processing Pipeline
- Created end-to-end document processing workflow
- Processed 5 sample documents per category (80 total documents)
- Generated structured JSON outputs for each document

### 6. Spatial Feature Analysis
- Analyzed spatial distribution of text elements
- Generated visualizations for:
  - X/Y coordinate distributions
  - Text element area analysis
  - Category-wise text element counts

### 7. Quality Assessment
- Calculated text quality metrics (word count, character count, confidence scores)
- Performed category-wise quality analysis
- Generated comprehensive quality reports with recommendations

### 8. Documentation & Reporting
- Created processing logs for tracking success/failure rates
- Generated summary dataset for Week 2 processing
- Produced visualizations for all key metrics

## 📊 Key Results

**Processing Statistics:**
- ✅ Total Documents Processed: 80 (5 per category)
- ✅ Success Rate: ~95%+
- ✅ Average OCR Confidence: 70-85%
- ✅ Structured JSON Outputs: 80 files

**Quality Metrics:**
- Average word count per document: Varies by category
- Text elements extracted: 50-500+ per document
- Spatial coordinates: Captured for all text elements

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Google Colab** (Cloud Computing)
- **OpenCV** (Image Processing)
- **Tesseract OCR** (Text Extraction)
- **PIL/Pillow** (Image Handling)
- **Pandas** (Data Analysis)
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (Visualization)
- **NumPy** (Numerical Computing)

## 📝 JSON Output Schema

Each processed document generates a structured JSON file containing:

```json
{
  "filename": "document.tif",
  "category": "invoice",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-15T...",
  "preprocessing": {
    "completed": true,
    "output_path": "/path/to/processed/image"
  },
  "ocr": {
    "total_elements": 150,
    "text_elements": ["text1", "text2", ...],
    "spatial_coordinates": [
      {"x": 10, "y": 20, "width": 100, "height": 30, ...}
    ],
    "confidence_scores": [85.5, 90.2, ...]
  },
  "full_text": "Complete extracted text..."
}
```

## 📈 Visualizations Generated

1. **Dataset Distribution** - Bar chart and pie chart of documents per category
2. **Preprocessing Comparison** - Before/after preprocessing samples
3. **Spatial Feature Analysis** - X/Y coordinate distributions and text element areas
4. **Text Quality Metrics** - Word count, confidence score distributions
5. **Processing Report** - Success/failure rates and category-wise statistics

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **Preprocessing is Critical**: Noise removal and deskewing significantly improved OCR accuracy
2. **Spatial Data Value**: Bounding box coordinates are essential for future layout analysis
3. **Quality Variation**: Different document categories have varying OCR accuracy levels
4. **Scalability**: The pipeline can efficiently process large document collections


## 🐛 Known Issues & Improvements

- Tesseract OCR confidence can be lower for handwritten documents
- Some complex layouts require additional preprocessing
- Consider upgrading to Google Vision API for better accuracy on difficult documents
